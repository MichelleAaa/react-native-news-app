## Launch Instructions

Clone this repository to your local machine. 

You will need [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), [`expo`](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/), and [`android studio`](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed on your machine.  

After installing Android Studio, you will also need to install a virtual device. Testing for this project was done using the Pixel XL API 30 (Android 11.0).

NewsAPI API key:
This project requires an API key, and for security reasons, my key has not been saved to GitHub. Please visit NewsAPI(https://newsapi.org/) to get your own free Developer key.

NewsAPI Key Example

![NewsAPI Key Example](assets/readme-img/NewsAPI-Key.png "Please see on the left side of the VS code file folder menu, you can open Components -> newsAPI_config. Once in the file, please create a folder labeled 'API_key'. Then inside, please create a file labeled 'API_key.js'. Inside the 'API_key.js' file, please type in 'export const _api_key = '';. Inside the '', please enter the API key value provided to you when you signed up for NewsAPI.")

Next, please open a terminal inside the main project folder, news.

Project Node Module Installation:

`npm install`   

To Start Expo:

`expo start`  

Expo will open a webpage located at http://localhost:19002/. 

Before you can use the application, you will need to launch Android Studio. Once you have launched it, please click on More Actions -> Virtual Device Manager. This will open a panel showing you your installed virtual phones. Please click the play button on the device and wait for the phone to load.

Once the Android Studio phone has loaded, you can return to the webpage that was generated by Expo. From there, in the menu on the left side click on 'Run on Android Device/Emulator'. The application will now run on the Android phone you launched.


**Please note that this application requires an internet connection due to relying on API data.  

## Reflection

I built this project after studying React Native in the Nucamp Full Stack Web and Mobile Application Development Bootcamp. This mini-project helped me familiarize myself with working with React Native and also how to work with an API.
